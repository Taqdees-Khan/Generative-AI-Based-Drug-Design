DOCKING VALIDATION

The docking protocol was validated by re-docking erlotinib to its 
crystallographic pose in the EGFR structure (PDB ID: 1M17). The 
validation was performed using AutoDock Vina 1.1.2 (May 11, 2011) with a grid centered 
at coordinates (22.0, 0.2, 52.8) Å 
and dimensions of 20×20×20 Å. Docking parameters included an 
exhaustiveness of 64 and generation of 20 poses. The root-mean-square 
deviation (RMSD) between the docked and crystallographic poses was 
5.33 Å for heavy atoms, calculated using optimal Kabsch alignment.
